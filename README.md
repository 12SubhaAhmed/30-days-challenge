I am starting a 30-day AI Driven Development challenge to upgrade myself as a modern developer. 
For the next month, I will build projects using AI tools to speed up research, planning, coding, testing, and deployment.
The goal is to stop wasting time on repetitive tasks and focus more on architecture, system thinking, and real problem-solving.
By the end of 30 days, I want to become faster, more confident, and closer to working like a professional AI-assisted developer.
