5 Core Concepts of SPECKit Plus

1️⃣ /constitution 

This step is about understanding the purpose of the project. Here we decide why we are doing the project, what problem it solves, and what the main goal is. It gives us a clear starting point.

2️ /specify 

In this step, we clearly write what our project needs. This includes the features, requirements, and tools we will use. It helps us know exactly what we have to create.

3️⃣ /plan 

The planning step is where we break the project into smaller parts. We decide what to do first, what to do next, and how much time each part will take. A good plan makes the project easier.

4️⃣ /tasks 

Tasks are the small pieces of work we need to finish the project. Each task is simple and doable. When we complete all tasks one by one, the whole project gets done smoothly.

5️⃣ /implement 

This is the step where we actually start doing the work. We follow our plan and complete the tasks to bring the project to life.
